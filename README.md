# To-Do List

This is a simple To-Do list to add tasks and check them off when done, we can also remove tasks that are not needed.

The best feature is that all the tasks added in the webpage is automatically uploaded to a SQL database.

### Pickup where you left off!
All the tasks added before closing the webpage will be updated with the database *`along with their status (checked or not)`*, So that all the tasks are synchronized and will be visible the next time the page is opened!

### Use it *anywhere* and *anytime!*
When hosted on a local server, this list can be accessed using any device connected to the LAN. All the tasks *will be synchronized among all the devices*.
